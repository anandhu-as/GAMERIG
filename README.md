# GAMERIG
Sure! Here’s a concise paragraph version for your GitHub README:

A React + TypeScript game store app built with Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM, and Material UI. It fetches games asynchronously from the FreeToGame API via a CORS proxy and lets users browse and filter games by Popular or Most Rated. Fully responsive and type-safe, this app demonstrates modern React state management, async thunks, and a clean, responsive UI.
